QUIZ APP (#7DaysofCodeChallenge)

This app developed and designed by me as an assessment of my understanding of the course undertaken under udacity.
The app has two  Activities, One that allows the user to check a checkbox and start the quiz and the second activiy that
contains the questions, a summary button to display the score summary and a reset button that allows the user to 
re enter into the quiz.
